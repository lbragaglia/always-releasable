						<p>DevOps Research and Assessment metrics:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Lead time for changes: How long does it take to go from code committed to code successfully running in production?</li>
							<li>Deployment frequency: How often does your organization deploy code to production or release it to end users?</li>
							<li>Change failure rate: What percentage of changes to production or released to users result in degraded service (e.g., lead to service impairment or service outage) and subsequently require remediation (e.g., require a hotfix, rollback, fix forward, patch)?</li>
							<li>Time to restore service: How long does it generally take to restore service when a service incident or a defect that impacts users occurs (e.g., unplanned outage, service impairment)?</li>

					    Release Flag: Enable true CI/CD
        Avoid creating a separate feature branch and branch merge nightmare
        “Decouple feature deployment and feature release”
        You no longer need to dread the big launch day. Your code would have been in production for several days or weeks before it becomes open to users
    Experiment: Canary testing or A/B testing. Release new features to production to a small population of users. For instance:
        Release new UI feature for users who opted in for beta testing
    Entitlement/Access Management: Unlike most other feature flags, this type of flag has a longer lifecycle
        Control access to features based on user access level, subscription category, and so on
    Ops Flag: This is essentially a manual circuit breaker
        Kill-switch that offers gracefully degradation of a system under stress during peak load, but maintains essential features
        Essential for any feature that would impact the performance of the system
    Business Flag: Enable or disable feature based on geography, time of year, and so on
        A global app that enables features based on the country you are in
        Enable free subscription for just a weekend

					<p>Best Practices and Avoiding Technical Debt</p>
					<ul>
					<li>
					    Each feature should have its own flag. Never re-use a flag</li>
    <li>Appropriate naming of each flag is vital to avoid any ambiguity</li>
    <li>Short-lived flags such as release flags, experimental flags, etc. should be promptly removed once the feature is live</li>
    <li>Control and audit access to flags</li>
    <li>Look at breaking down the feature sufficiently before looking at Release Flags</li>

					<h3>Branch by abstraction</h3>
					<p>Introduce an abstraction layer to decouple dependencies to apply big impact or long running changes.</p>
